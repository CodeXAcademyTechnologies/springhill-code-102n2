## Learning Goals

### Input and Output: Collecting user input, and using it to determine and product output

1. What are some real world applications of a website collecting user input, and using it to determine and produce an output?

- submitting email in a form (input), the computer saves/stores your email, and autoemails you when the store unlocks
- click a button to view image gallery
- click a button/check a box to change from light mode to dark mode
- entering your email to get sent a promo code
- creating an account/logging in

Concepts to help us collect input and produce output.

- variables
- prompt() function
- console.log
- document.write
- data types
- conditionals
- operators

## How number comparison works in age function

JavaScript feature called "type coercion". Automatically converts values between different data types in certain situations. In this case, it compares the string input with numbers using comparison operators like <= or <, JavaScript tries to be helpful and converts the string to a number before making the comparison.

Be careful with type coercion because it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. That's why it's generally recommended to explicitly convert user input to the desired type. But for now this serves our purpose.
