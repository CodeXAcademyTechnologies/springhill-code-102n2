# Class 06
## Agenda:
- Review of previous class
  - Share your learning
- JavaScript
  - Recap from Code 101
  - Discussion Exercise
- From Mockup to Markup
  - Demo: Input and Output
  - Lab: Plan and Build

## New Vocabulary:
- JavaScript
- conditionals
- operators: 
- data types: 
- variable:
- console: A tool or interface that allows you to interact with a program or programming environment. It provides a way to display output, receive input, and execute commands or code snippets. The most common type of console you'll encounter is a developer console or browser console. It's a feature built into web browsers that allows developers to monitor and debug their web applications.

## Learning Goals:

### Input and Output: Collecting user input, and using it to determine and product output

1. What are some real world applications of a website collecting user input, and using it to determine and produce an output?
  - Social media bio
  - Creating an account/logging in
  - Social media age limits
  - Quiz, whether or not answer checked is correct and how it affects a score
  
Concepts to help us collect input and produce output.
- variables
- prompt() function
- console.log
- document.write
- data types
- conditionals
- operators

## How number comparison works in time function:
JavaScript feature called "type coercion". Automatically converts values between different data types in certain situations. In this case, it compares the string input with numbers using comparison operators like <= or <, JavaScript tries to be helpful and converts the string to a number before making the comparison.

Be careful with type coercion because it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. That's why it's generally recommended to explicitly convert user input to the desired type. But for now this serves our purpose.

## Structure

- WHY, what's the question or problem? In English...
- WHAT, What is the solution or concepts we're going to use? In English..
- HOW, What does this look like in code, how do we build it? In code...

- Scale of 1-5. Have someone who gets it explain.
